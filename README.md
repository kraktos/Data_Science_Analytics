# Data_Science_Analytics
Collection of data science problems from different sources.

This consists of different problems classified under individual folders. Each one has the problem description, along with the 
relevant problem link. I do not guarantee that the links would still work. But, the problem has been re-stated for future reference.
Lets have fun !!

Each file has its own README. And if any special setting is required, it will be mentioned in it.
